# CAN-Guru Changelog

## Version 0.1.0 (WIP)

### Features

- CAN Database Management: CAN database files can be conveniently selected from the file system and listed. A checkbox feature next to the database list item defines whether it'll be utilized in the CAN trace window.
- Trace Window: A trace window has been added that displays CAN information on the bus or from a file. This provides live tracking and data analysis capabilities for CAN information.
- Configuration Window: A configuration window has been added that allows the user to playback CAN data from a file. This data can then be decoded and displayed in the trace window. Users can select the "From File" option to choose the desired files for playback.
